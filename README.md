## About

[![Read Docs](https://app.devdoq.com/shields/read_docs.png)](http://localhost:3000/dashboard/1004977486?name=smacknet)

smacknet is a web-based tool designed for launching HTTP and TCP network attacks. It empowers users to easily configure attack parameters, manage proxy lists, and customize user agents. Monitor your attack statistics in real-time through a user-friendly interface.

## Built With

*   **Next.js:** Frontend and backend framework for building the application.
*   **TypeScript:** For type safety and improved developer experience.
*   **Web Workers:** Used to perform attack operations in the background, keeping the UI responsive.

## Getting Started

This section guides you through setting up and running the smacknet application.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/smacknet.git
    cd smacknet
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    This will launch the smacknet web interface, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Configure and launch attacks:**
    Use the web interface to input your target, select attack methods, and configure parameters like proxies, user agents, and attack duration. Click the "Play" button to start an attack.

## Usage

Configure and launch attacks with `smacknet` by specifying your target, attack method, and optional parameters.

*   **Target:** The IP address or domain to attack.
*   **Attack Method:** Choose from supported methods like `http_flood`, `http_bypass`, `http_slowloris`, `tcp_flood`, or `minecraft_ping`.
*   **Proxies:** Provide a list of proxies to distribute the attack. `smacknet` will filter them based on the attack method.
*   **User Agents:** Optionally, specify custom user agents for HTTP-based attacks.
*   **Duration:** Set the attack duration in seconds.

**Example Command:**

```bash
smacknet --target 192.168.1.100 --method http_flood --proxies proxies.txt --duration 60
```

## Configuration

Configure proxies and user agents directly through the application's settings interface.

*   **Proxies:** Add or manage your list of proxy servers. The application will automatically infer protocols and ports where possible.
*   **User Agents:** Provide a list of user agent strings to be used during attacks. This helps in mimicking different client types.

## Attack Methods

SmackNet supports a variety of attack methods to simulate different types of network stress. Each method is designed to target specific network protocols and vulnerabilities.

*   **`http_flood`**: Overwhelms HTTP/HTTPS servers with a high volume of requests.
*   **`http_bypass`**: Attempts to bypass common HTTP defenses by using various proxy types.
*   **`http_slowloris`**: Exploits HTTP servers by keeping connections open for as long as possible, consuming server resources.
*   **`tcp_flood`**: Floods the target with a large number of TCP connection requests.
*   **`minecraft_ping`**: Specifically targets Minecraft servers by sending a high volume of ping requests.
